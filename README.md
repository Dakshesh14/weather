# Hello World!

I am Dev and let's me this quick, I am a web developer. I love to make things and hence I love my job! I am good in language like Python, JavaScript, CSS and yeah also HTML. I use popular and powerful frameworks & library like Django, react, Bootstrap, etc…

## This web app is made using react
We fetch data and display it to user so that they can see weather in there area.

If you read so far I just wanna say that I had no intention to write all this but just wanted to replace org readme of react
